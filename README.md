Deepfake technology has proliferated because of GAN evolution which resulted in highly realistic synthetic media development. 
The development of deepfakes technology reads new paths in content creation and entertainment but generates multiple severe moral and legal challenges alongside security risks. 
Deepfake images specifically function as tools for harmful activities which allow users to spread false information while faking identity and damaging digital content trust. 
The identification of undisclosed forgeries proves difficult especially while operating in real-time on limited computing platforms.
A high-performance deepfake image detection framework based on MobileNetV2 architecture serves as the main proposal for this project. 
MobileNetV2 delivers an optimal blend between its accurate results and energy-efficient operation which enables it to succeed in mobile and embedded systems. 
This research applies a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 design to analyze real and deepfake facial images which were selected from Kaggle. 
The network employs depthwise separable convolutions together with inverted residual blocks as an effective method to extract discriminating features which distinguish authentic images from synthetic ones.
The training methods incorporate data augmentations as well as transfer learning and binary cross-entropy loss together with Adam optimizer to produce better generalization results. 
The model evaluation uses accuracy alongside precision recall F1-score and standard metric of accuracy. 
Evaluation tests show that the MobileNetV2-based system reaches superior classification i.e. while operating at a pace that maintains small memory requirements and brief inference times. 
The final implementation reached 76% accuracy, highlighting the capability of resource-optimized architectures in image forensics.
The study proves that the real-time deepfake detection system can use MobileNetV2 as its backbone to achieve effective detection functionality. 
The proposed leveraging of MobileNetV2 shows potential as a deployable solution for different practical applications such as social networks and 
forensic tools and content authentication systems which assists the battle to fight synthetic media and digital misinformation.
